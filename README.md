What are you going to make?

Obstacle detection:
    Collision alert
    Automatic braking
    Drive around obstacle

Mobility:
    Forward
    Reverse
    Stop
    Turn left and right

Cruise control:
    Static
    Adaptive (sonar)

Voice control:
    Basic mobility

Autonomous parking:
    Parallel parking

Autonomous driving: 
    Drive between the lines

Tail lamps and head lamps

Why will you make it?
The obstacle detection feature will make sure that the car won’t crash into stationary or moving objects (safety feature).

The cruise control feature will be added to allow for less human interaction, it will give one less thing to worry about. 

The car needs to be able to manoeuvre forward, backwards, left ,right and also be able to stop in order to fulfill the basic needs of a car and so it would be sellable. 

The voice control will be included in order to allow the user to direct the car using their voice.

The autonomous parking will be made in order to allow for less human interaction.

Another safety feature that will be included on the car is tail lamps and head lamps. The reason why this is a safety feature is so the car could be visible in the dark or when the vehicle breaks the break lights will be activated.

How it will be made?
Obstacle detection will be made by using infrared and ultrasonic sensors.
Mobility will be implemented through the smartcar library and the gyroscope.
Cruise control, autopilot and autoparking will be managed by an ultrasonic sensor.
Raspberry pi will be used for the voice control.
