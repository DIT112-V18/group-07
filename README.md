## What are we going to make?
- We aim to create a remote controlled car emphasizing on hassle-free use and automation. 

## Obstacle detection and manoeuvring:
* Alert for detection of obstacle
* Automatic braking upon detecting obstacle 
* Drive around obstacle when detected

## Mobility:
* Forward
* Reverse
* Stop
* Turn left and right

## Sportmode: 
 ** WHEN SPORTMODE IS ON
* Speed is set to maximum speed instantly
* Speed is decreased instantly meaning instant braking

 ** WHEN SPORTMODE IS OFF
* Speed is increased or decreased gradually 
* Does not reach maximum speed

## Cruise control:
* Static Cruise Control. User can set a defined speed
* Adaptive Cruise Control. Adapts the speed to the object infront of it

## Autonomous parking:
* The car will search for parking and then parallel park when the space is found

## Tilt control: 
* Turning left or right by tilting the phone 

## Autopilot driving: 
* Car will be able to drive on and follow a single line

## Tail lamps and head lamps
* Tail lamps will turn on upon braking
* The user will be able to toggle the head lamps on and off

## Why will we make it?
* The obstacle detection feature ensures the safety of the car and it's surroundings. It will make sure that the car doesn't crash into stationary or moving objects.
* The cruise control feature will be added to minimise the need of repeated user input to perform basic straight line mobility. 
* The car needs to be able to manoeuvre forward, backwards, left ,right and also be able to stop in order to provide the staple functionalities of a car. 
* The tilt control feature provides an easier way to maneuver the car. By tilting the phone, the car will either move left or right. Eliminating the problem of tapping several buttons to move the car left and right. It is a smarter way of moving the car.
* Parking esentially follows a general algorithm. We have employed this algorithm to automate parking of the car, hence reducing redundant work-load on the user. 
* Tail lamps and brake lamps increase visibility of the car in it's surroundings, thus adding to the factor of safety. 

## How will it be made?
* Obstacle detection and manoeuvring will be made by using infrared sensors, ultrasonic sensors and a servo motor (to mount the ultrasonic sensor).
* Mobility will be implemented through the smartcar library and the gyroscope.
* Cruise control, autopilot and autonomous parking will be managed by an ultrasonic sensor.
* Tilt Control will be managed by the gyroscope in the users mobile device.
